   <h3>
      Background
   </h3>
   <p>
      Most of our University websites are not easily viewable on smart devices with small
      screen (e.g. iOS, Android smartphones). As an example, access the
      <a href="https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/">
         Computer Science website
      </a> from a smartphone, and see how easy or difficult
      it is to read and navigate.
   </p>
   <p>
      One of the good approaches to fix this is to have an architecture that
      (1) separates information content from the user-interface
      and to make available the information as a service (e.g., a web service), and
      (2) allows thin-client applications for smart devices that consume the information service and
      render the information in such a way that fits well within the interface paradigm of the device.
      This is an approach taken by a number of news media providers (such as BBC and New Zealand
      Herald) to provide a richer experience to the readers.
      The application constructed in (2) could be a native device application or it could
      be a responsive web application.
   </p>
   <p>
      This assignment looks at the separation of data from the UI, and how such data can
      be consumed and used in the end-user application. It also looks at potential vulnerabilities
      that could arise from such an architecture.
   </p>
   <p>
      A number of data sources that supply key information content that is part of the Computer Science
      site have been identified. These enable separation of information content from the
      presentation.
   </p>
   <p>
      A brief description of data sources is given below.
   </p>
   <ol>
      <li>
         Get a detailed list of staff. The URL <a href="https://unidirectory.auckland.ac.nz/rest/search?orgFilter=COMSCI">
            https://unidirectory.auckland.ac.nz/rest/search?orgFilter=COMSCI
         </a> provides this list.
         <br>
         Photos of staff
         could be obtained from URLs of the form
         <a href="https://unidirectory.auckland.ac.nz/people/imageraw/rnic033/10300628/small">https://unidirectory.auckland.ac.nz/people/imageraw/{PersonID}/{Imageid}/small</a>
         where the two IDs are available in the staff list.
         Address book entries for each staff,
         in the form of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VCard">
            vCard
         </a>, can be obtained from <a href="https://unidirectory.auckland.ac.nz/people/vcard/rnic033">
            https://unidirectory.auckland.ac.nz/people/vcard/{PersonID}
         </a>.
      </li>
      <li>
         Get a feed of current news items. The URL <a href="https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/en/about/newsandevents/news/_jcr_content/par/newssearchlist.rss">
            https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/en/about/newsandevents/news/_jcr_content/par/newssearchlist.rss
         </a>
         provides this feed.
      </li>
      <li>
         Get a feed of current notices. The URL <a href="https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/en/about/newsandevents/notices/_jcr_content/par/noticesearchlist.rss">
            https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/en/about/newsandevents/notices/_jcr_content/par/noticesearchlist.rss
         </a>
         provides this feed.
      </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
      Firstly, study these data sources carefully.
      You can experiment with the sources using your browser and the inspection tools
      available with your browser
      (e.g., <em>Web Inspector</em> on Safari, <a href="https://getfirebug.com/"><em>Firebug</em></a>
      on Firefox, or <em>F12</em> on Chrome and IE). You may also wish to use HTTP debugging
      tools such as <a href="http://www.telerik.com/fiddler">Fiddler</a>, <a href="https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/courses/compsci215s1c/resources/mano/W3Client-MacOS-10_10-x64.zip">
         W3Client (MacOS)
      </a>, and <a href="https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/courses/compsci215s1c/resources/mano/W3Client.exe">
         W3Client (Windows)
      </a>.
   </p>
   <h3>A Test Application</h3>
   <p>
      Firstly, attempt to build a simple test application consuming the staff list data source.
      We want you to observe the difficulties in doing this. Read the Wiki article
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing</a>
      and how this article relates to the difficulties you may have faced.
   </p>
   <h3>Test Application - Take 2</h3>
   <p>
      You are now asked to experiment with the data sources provided at
      <a href="http://redsox.tcs.auckland.ac.nz/ups/UniProxService.svc/help">
         http://redsox.tcs.auckland.ac.nz/ups/UniProxService.svc/help
      </a>.
      Attempt to build another test application consuming the staff list data source
      that is available
      at <a href="http://redsox.tcs.auckland.ac.nz/ups/UniProxService.svc/people">
         http://redsox.tcs.auckland.ac.nz/ups/UniProxService.svc/people
      </a>.
      We want you to observe that consuming this source within the application
      does not pose any issue. Now see what makes this data source different from
      the one you tried earlier.
   </p>
   <h3>Computer Science @ UoA</h3>
   <p>
      You are now ready to build the real application consuming the data offered
      at <a href="http://redsox.tcs.auckland.ac.nz/ups/UniProxService.svc/help">
         http://redsox.tcs.auckland.ac.nz/ups/UniProxService.svc/help
      </a>.
      You may use the University logo available at
      <a href="http://redsox.tcs.auckland.ac.nz/ups/logo.svg">http://redsox.tcs.auckland.ac.nz/ups/logo.svg</a>
      as you deem fit.
   </p>
   <p>
      The application should consist of the following logical sections:
   </p>
   <dl>
      <dt>Home</dt>
      <dd>
         This section contains an introduction to the Department.
         You could borrow the brief introduction provided at the Department's current
         page. For example,
         <em>
            "Welcome to New Zealand's leading computer science department.
            We pride ourselves on the excellence of our staff and our students."
         </em>
      </dd>
      <dt>Courses</dt>
      <dd>
         This is a list of courses offered by the Department.
      </dd>
      <dt>People</dt>
      <dd>
         This is a list of staff at the Department. You would want to provide
         means of contacting them (such as email and telephone) as well as the
         means to save details in an address book (the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VCard">
            vCards
         </a> come handy here).
      </dd>
      <dt>News</dt>
      <dd>
         This is the current news feed.
      </dd>
      <dt>Notices</dt>
      <dd>
         This is the current notices feed.
      </dd>
      <dt>Guest Book</dt>
      <dd>
         This is where guest comments can be entered into.
      </dd>
   </dl>
   <p>
      The application should use a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
      Where the application needs icons, please consider using an appropriate Unicode character that represents the icon.
      For example, please note that the "caution" sign (<span style="font-size: normal;">⚠</span>) used earlier
      in this page is a Unicode character.
   </p>
   <p>
      Please note the following requirements.
   </p>
   <ol>
      <li>
         You are <em>not</em> allowed to use any libraries or frameworks.
      </li>
      <li>
         The application should contain a single HTML page (named
         <em>index.html</em>).
      </li>
      <li>
         The application should work on any modern browser (such as Chrome, Safari and Edge).
      </li>
      <li>
         The application should work on small screen devices.
         You can test this by making your browser window narrow.
      </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
      This application, unlike the two test applications, is marked, and should be of a professional quality to attract full marks.
      You should pay attention to details.
   </p>
   <h3>
      Pen-Testing the Service
   </h3>
   <p>
      It is thought the back-end service has a number of vulnerabilities. You are now asked to
      penetration-test the service, and report your findings.
   </p>
   <p>
      For this part, you will use local versions of the service and its associated data.
      To this end, please download copies of the service and the data first.
      You also need to change the <em>Web.config</em> file in the service to point
      to the local location where you have saved the data.
   </p>
   <ol>
      <li>
         <a href="https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/courses/compsci335s2c/assignments/mano/Svc.zip">
            Service
         </a>. Unzip the service and place it in a folder such as <em>H:\335\A2\Svc</em>.
      </li>
      <li>
         <a href="https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/courses/compsci335s2c/assignments/mano/CSUoAData.zip">
            Data
         </a>. Unzip the data and place it in a folder such as <em>H:\335\A2\Data</em>.
      </li>
      <li>
         Now open the Web.config file in the service folder, and find the line:
         <br>
         &lt;add key="DataRoot" value="C:/WebRoot/CSUoAData/"/&gt;<br>
         Change the value field to reflect where you saved the data.
         E.g., <em>H:\335\A2\Data\CSUoAData</em>.
      </li>
      <li>
         You can then run the service using the following command line:<br>
         <em>"C:\Program Files\IIS Express\IISExpress.exe" /port:8188 /path:H:\335\A2\Svc</em><br>
         <br>
         If you want to run IIS Express from a Windows PowerShell, you need to prefix the above command line with &amp;
         so that PowerShell can execute the command (rather than treating the command as a string):<br>
         <em>&amp; "C:\Program Files\IIS Express\IISExpress.exe" /port:8188 /path:H:\335\A2\Svc</em><br>
         <br>
         Test the service by pointing your browser to <a href="http://localhost:8188/UniProxService.svc/help">
            http://localhost:8188/UniProxService.svc/help
         </a>. The browser is expected to show the
         API doc you saw at <a href="http://redsox.tcs.auckland.ac.nz/ups/UniProxService.svc/help">
            http://redsox.tcs.auckland.ac.nz/ups/UniProxService.svc/help
         </a>.
         <br>
         If the data and the service are correctly set up, you should see a detailed
         list of staff when you point your browser to
         <a href="http://localhost:8188/UniProxService.svc/people">http://localhost:8188/UniProxService.svc/people</a>.
         Note that the output shown in the browser may not be well-formatted, and in this
         case, you may wish to view the source to see the unformatted content.

      </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
      You may find it helpful to use the UI you have already developed. This will require
      you to change the service URI base in your UI implementation to point to the local service.
      While you may use the UI for the initial testing, you must verify your observations
      using a standalone HTTP tool such as
      <a href="https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/courses/compsci215s1c/resources/mano/W3Client.exe">
         W3Client
      </a>.
   </p>
   <p>
      Please answer the questions below. Where the questions require you to
      write an HTTP request, please provide a URL if the request is GET; if the request
      is POST, please provide the complete request including all the necessary HTTP headers.
      E.g.,
   </p>
   <div style="border: 1px solid black; border-radius: 5px; padding: 10px;">
      <span class="code">
         POST http://www.site.org/foo.cgi?t=Find HTTP/1.1<br>
         Host: www.site.org<br>
         Content-Type: text/plain<br>
         Content-Length: 5<br>
         <br>
         Hello<br>
      </span>
   </div>
   <ol>
      <li>
         Find out where HTML injection is possible within the service APIs.
         Write down an HTTP request that inserts an arbitrary image into the UI you constructed.
      </li>
      <li>
         Write down an HTTP request that leads to executing a user-supplied script.
      </li>
      <li>
         Find out where SQL injection is possible within the service APIs.
         Write down an HTTP request that injects SQL.
      </li>
   </ol>
   <h3>
      Bonus
   </h3>
   <p>
      Develop a native Android or iOS application consuming the data sources provided.
      You should not use "boxing" techniques such as that provided
      by <a href="https://cordova.apache.org/">Apache Cordova</a>, but rather
      develop natively using Android Studio or XCode.
      Compare the native application development effort to that of the web application.
   </p>
   <p>
      The bonus part is optional.
   </p>
   <h3>
      Submission
   </h3>
   <p>
      You are required to submit to the <a href="https://adb.auckland.ac.nz/">
         Assignment Dropbox
      </a> the following items.
   </p>
   <ol>
      <li>
         A ZIP archive containing your source files of the CS @ UoA application.
      </li>
      <li>
         A <em>plain text</em> file containing your answers to the pen-testing questions.
      </li>
      <li>
         A copy of the AS-75 form pre-filled with your details.
         This is optional if you have worked on the assignment solution and source code
         entirely on your own.
      </li>
